### infinity-table
My code for driving 50 RGB leds in an infinity table using python and MQTT (mosquitto) as the interface, or a simple stand-alone program.

# Running
For using MQTT as an interface:

<code> sudo python main-mqtt.py </code>

or for running a stand-alone (non-interactive) program:

<code> sudo python main-static.py </code>

# How it works
Uhhh... I'll type this up later

# Installation
1) Configure your GPIO pins and SPI
2) install your mosquitto server
3) configure the settings.conf file
4) run
